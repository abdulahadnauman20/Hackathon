# Spec-Kit Plus Project Structure

This project follows the Spec-Kit Plus methodology for spec-driven development.

## Directory Structure

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution and core principles
- `.specify/templates/` - Template files for specs, plans, tasks, and PHRs
- `.specify/commands/` - Custom command definitions
- `specs/` - Feature specifications (created as needed)
- `history/prompts/` - Prompt History Records organized by category
- `history/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records (created as needed)

## Core Workflow

1. Define feature specifications in the `specs/` directory
2. Create implementation plans based on specs
3. Generate tasks from plans
4. Implement and track progress
5. Maintain Prompt History Records for all interactions

## Constitutional Compliance

All work must align with the principles defined in the constitution file.
